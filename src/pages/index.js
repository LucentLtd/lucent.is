                Electra Productions is a dance production company founded by
                Linley Faulkner and Jane Bull. Theâ€™ve produced multiple sold-out
                dance performances in Victoria, BC that attracted performers
                from across Canada and the United States.

                30 Hour Jobs is a job board and community for job seekers who
                need or want to work less than 40 hours per week and employers
                who support this. Nick created 30 Hour Jobs with the belief
                that, while many people will work more than 30 hours per week,
                the number of hours dedicated to an employer alone should be
                less than it is currently. By reducing the expected time
                commitment to employers, individuals will have more time to
                raise their families, engage in their community, work on their
                passions, and do great things.

                applications for Android and iOS.
