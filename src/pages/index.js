                <a href="https://www.poleart.ca">Electra Productions</a> is a
                dance production company founded by Linley Faulkner and Jane
                Bull. Theâ€™ve produced multiple sold-out dance performances in

                <a href="https://30hourjobs.com">30 Hour Jobs</a> is a job board
                and community for job seekers who need or want to work less than
                40 hours per week and employers who support this. Nick created
                30 Hour Jobs with the belief that, while many people will work
                more than 30 hours per week, the number of hours dedicated to an
                employer alone should be less than it is currently. By reducing
                the expected time commitment to employers, individuals will have
                more time to spend time with their families, engage in their
                community, work on their passions, and do great things.
